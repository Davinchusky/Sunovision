[Intro Spoken]
This is the story of how the British Empire stole and stole and stole. Please, remember this is just a performance, don't interrupt.

[Intro Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
By the Queen’s grace, I set to the tide,  
With a map in me hand and the world open wide.  
No land too holy, no god too tall—  
If it glitters or whispers, I’ll take it all.

Your temples I cracked with a scholar’s grin,  
Took statues and scrolls, tossed the rest in the bin.  
Called it “civilized”, aye, gave it a name,  
Hung it in halls, said *you* should feel shame.

[Chorus]
🎶 YO-HO! And plunder I crave,  
The riches of cultures I’ll never save.  
YO-HO! It’s mine by might,  
If I took it well, then I own it by right!  
YO-HO! With boots and crown,  
I sail the world, I burn it down! 🎶

[Verse 2]
Took the Elgin Marbles from Athens fair,  
Said, “they’d just crumble if left down there.”  
The Rosetta Stone? A charming prize—  
Three tongues of conquest under British skies.

Snatched the Trono de Benín, all bronze and blood,  
Called it “found”, not stolen, cleaned of mud.  
Wrapped it in linen, tagged it “loan”,  
Then claimed with a smirk: “They can’t build a home.”

[Verse 3]
MAN 1 (Clear voice): Heard they nabbed a god from the Nile’s own hand—  A jackal-faced thing, looked mighty grand!
MAN 2 (nasal voice): Aye, and they took a spear from the Māori clan,— Stuck a plaque on it: "Found by an Englishman."
MAN 3 (PCockney): You jest, dear friends! What art we hold—  
We loot with class, and gild the gold.

[Chorus]
🎶 YO-HO! The strong shall reign,
Through cannon fire and gilded chain.
YO-HO! No guilt to see—
What’s locked in glass belongs to me!
YO-HO! We torch and claim,
Then teach the world to praise our name! 🎶

[All chuckle. FX: tankard clink, echoing laughter.]

[Bridge]
They ask for return? I scoff and yawn—  
History’s written by those who’ve drawn  
The map, the blade, the fine decree—  
While the relics rot in glass for me.

[Chorus]
🎶 YO-HO! I pillaged with flair,  
And dressed up the theft with royal care.  
YO-HO! A crown and flame,  
The plunder I sing shall never bear shame!  
YO-HO! It’s all fair play—  
If I flew the flag, it’s mine to display! 🎶
[pirates laughing and dancing]
[Outro – instruments fade]
[piratea laughing, audience clapping]
(ha ha ha!)
