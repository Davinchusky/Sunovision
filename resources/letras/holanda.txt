[Verse 1 – Straight-faced sarcasm]
We say, “The Spaniards never work,”
That siestas make them lazy jerks.
We judge the sun, the sangría too,
Then book a Ryanair for booze.

We say, “They lie, they cheat, they grift,”
While blackout drunk in Magaluf.
Complain that “they don’t speak Dutch here!”
While drinking beer the size of deer.

[Chorus – Big, ironic, stomping beat]
Oink oink — look who's back!
Drunk in flip-flops, heart attack.
We call them pigs, but what’s the truth?
We trashed five towns before our youth.

Oink oink — shout olé!
But can’t say “hola,” just “no way!”
We mock their ways, then beg for sun —
And steal their joy... while calling them dumb.

[Verse 2 – Faster, more cutting]
We litter beaches, burn their trees,
And dry hump fountains on our knees.
Yell “Viva España!” with no clue —
Where we are, or what we do.

Valconing kings, oh how we fly —
Another Hans just broke his thigh.
You called them pigs from your safe North —
Then left your vomit by their porch.

[Bridge – Spoken, dry and brutal]
“Wait, this isn’t the Sagrada Familia?”
“That’s not paella — there’s no chorizo!”
“Why can’t I bring 30 beers into the cathedral?”
Hans… this is a country. Not your bachelor party.

[Final Chorus – Anthemic, unapologetic, flamenco guitars blazing]
Oink oink — mask is off!
It’s not the South that’s gone too soft.
You binge, you break, then play the snob —
And say “Spain should get a job.”

Oink oink — you curse the heat,
While throwing trash on every street.
They built cathedrals, you brought shame —
Now who's the pig? Say it. Name. 👏 The. 👏 Name. 👏

[Outro – Quiet, then BOOM drop]
You say España’s out of line?
But you left piss on the Alhambra sign.
So next time you whine at the airport bar —
Ask: who’s the tourist… and who’s the star?
